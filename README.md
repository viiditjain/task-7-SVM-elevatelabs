# 🧠 Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project is part of my **AI & ML Internship**.  
The objective is to use **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for both linear and non-linear classification using **Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand **SVM basics**: support vectors, margin maximization, kernel trick  
- Implement **linear and RBF SVMs**  
- **Visualize decision boundaries** (2D data)  
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma)**  
- Use **cross-validation** to evaluate model performance  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** Breast Cancer Dataset (built-in from Scikit-learn)  
- Alternative Dataset Link (Kaggle): [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)  

The dataset contains **30 features** computed from digitized images of a breast mass, and the target is binary:  
- `0` = Malignant  
- `1` = Benign

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
